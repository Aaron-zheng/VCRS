# VCRSsï¼šVoice-based Conversational Recommender Systems
This project aims to provide two voice-based conversational recommender systems datasets in the e-commerce and movie domains.

## Dataset
You can download datasets from GoogleDrive. The datasets consist of two parts: [coat.tar.gz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FnpYhMaeskckxGheKjar0U4YHIdDKM6K/view?usp=share_link) and [ml-1m.tar.gz](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FnpYhMaeskckxGheKjar0U4YHIdDKM6K/view?usp=share_link)

### Descriptions of Datasets
The data file is formatted as a mp3 file and the file name form is `diaidxx_uidxx_iidxx_xx_xx_xx.mp3`.

For example, for file `diaid0_uid21_iid246_20-30_women_269.mp3`, its meaning is as follows:
```
diaid0: corresponds to dialogue 0 in the text-based conversation dataset
uid21: user id is 21
iid246: item id is 246
20-30: the age of the user is between 20 and 30
women: user's gender is female
269: corresponds to speaker id in vctk dataset
```
